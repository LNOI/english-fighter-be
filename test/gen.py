On Wednesday, Dar Pfeiffer, one of the largest brokerage firms in the world, reported a second-quarter profit that was 53% larger than expected. The second-quarter profit was attributed to a one-time deal with money manager Tapcourt.

Shareholders saw this profit in the form of a $2.46 increase in share prices. The same period last year showed a $1.07 increase a share. Excluding the deal with Tapcourt, Dar Pfeiffer would have reported a profit 23% larger than expected. Either way, Dar Pfeiffer topped market predictions for performance by at least $1.58 a share.""",
