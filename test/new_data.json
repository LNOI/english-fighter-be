The second-quarter profit was attributed to a one-time deal with money manager Tapcourt.\n\nShareholders saw this profit in the form of a $2.46 increase in share prices. The same period last year showed a $1.07 increase a share. Excluding the deal with Tapcourt, Dar Pfeiffer would have reported a profit 23% larger than expected. Either way, Dar Pfeiffer topped market predictions for performance by at least $1.58 a share.",

The second-quarter profit was attributed to a one-time deal with money manager Tapcourt.\n\nShareholders saw this profit in the form of a $2.46 increase in share prices. The same period last year showed a $1.07 increase a share. Excluding the deal with Tapcourt, Dar Pfeiffer would have reported a profit 23% larger than expected. Either way, Dar Pfeiffer topped market predictions for performance by at least $1.58 a share.",
